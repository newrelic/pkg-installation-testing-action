## Example usage

name: ðŸ§¬ Testing package installation
on:
  push:

jobs:
  molecule-packaging-tests:
    name: Launch molecule tests with infra-agent package
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Testing that infra-agent package can be installed
        uses: newrelic/pkg-installation-testing-action@main
        with:
          repo_base_url: 'http://nr-downloads-ohai-staging.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/infrastructure_agent'
          package_name: 'newrelic-infra'
          package_version: '1.36.0'
          gpg_key: 'https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/gpg/newrelic-infra.gpg'
          platforms: "al2,al2022,centos7,centos8,debian-bullseye,debian-buster,redhat8,redhat9,suse15.2,suse15.3,suse15.4,ubuntu1604,ubuntu1804,ubuntu2004,ubuntu2204"
```


## Testing

The action uses Molecule to launch the Ansible roles into the different platforms container images. All the used images are uploaded to the repository's Github container registry so the user does not need to set its Docker credentials. If you perform changes to the docker images, you can generate a new molecule configuration file setting the environment variable `TESTING`:

```bash
$ TESTING=true ./prepare_platform.sh "centos7,centos8" 
```
